A *data sturcture* is a systematic way of organizing and accessing data, and an *algorithm* is a step-by-step procedure for performing some task in a finite amount of time. 

*Running time* is a natural measture of "goodness" since tims is a precious resource (we always want a computer soluution run as fast as possible.). Regradless of difference from hardware and software environments, we are interested in the relationship between the running time and the size of its input. 

## A common approach to record the time used of a algorithm

The time function measures relative to what is known as the "wall clock". It depends on the CPU of the computer. 

```
from time import time 
start_time = time()
## run some algorithms
end_time = time()
elapsed_time = end_time - start_time
```


## Moving Beyond Experimental Analysis 

We want to develop an approach to analyzing the efficiency of algorithms such that: 
1. Allows us to evaluate the relative efficiency of any two alogirthms in a way that is independent of the hardware and software environments 
2. Without any implementation 
3. Takes into account all possible inputs.
